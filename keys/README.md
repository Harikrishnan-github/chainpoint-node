# Authentication Key Restore Directory

Copy or create a `0xMYETHADDRESS.key` file to this directory that contains a backed up HMAC Auth key. You might find this file in the `backups` sub-directory.

When you restart your Node it will try to import this backup key to the Node's database.

The detailed documentation for this backup and restoration method can be found in the README.md file.
