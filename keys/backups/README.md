# Authentication Key Backup Directory

In this directory you'll find backup files for your Node's HMAC Auth keys.

You can copy one of these files to the `keys` directory that is the parent of this one, and restart your Node, to initiate restoration of a backed up key.

The detailed documentation for this backup and restore method can be found in the README.md file.
