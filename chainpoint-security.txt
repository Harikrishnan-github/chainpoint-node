Tierion Network Security

This file contains important information relevant to
the security of the Tierion Network and Chainpoint
software. This is considered the canonical source of
truth for related information.

Warning : You should never accept information provided
in public channels as being safe to use for security
sensitive information such as Ethereum contract
addresses. Those with malicious intent may for example
try to intercept TNT by publishing an illicit
destination addresses. Always consult this file if unsure.


Tierion Network Core

Core Clusters:

https://b.chainpoint.org/config
https://c.chainpoint.org/config

TLS Certificate

Issuer:
CloudFlare Inc ECC CA-2

Calendar Block Signature Public Keys
-----------------------------------------------------------

The partial hash (fingerprint) of each public key and
the Base64 encoded Ed25519 public key. Current public
keys are also available from the Core `/config` endpoints.

  "public_keys": {
    "09b0ec65fa25": "Q88brO55SfkY5S0Rbnyh3gh1s6izAj9v4BSWVF1dce0=",

  }


TNT -> Credits
-----------------------------------------------------------

When sending TNT to the Core service, in exchange
for Node operating credits, always send the TNT
to the Ethereum address:

0xddfff2b78463ab1ca781e853bb888fdfd06083d3

You must *always* send to this address from the
same Ethereum account your Node is registered with.

Currently, TNT are converted to credits at the
rate of 1 TNT = 200 credits. This will likely change
in the future and be based on a more dynamic rate of
exchange.


TNT Rewards
-----------------------------------------------------------

Rewards are issued every thirty minutes to a Node that
passes the eligibility criteria. Three Hundred Million
Tierion Network Tokens (TNT) will be distributed via
rewards over nearly eight years.

This schedule is divided up into fourteen epochs. Each
epoch lasts 200 days and contains 9600 reward periods.

Rewards decline 20% per epoch.

In the first epoch, the reward per period is 6,537.16 TNT.

Ninety-five percent goes to a Node (6,210.30 TNT) and
five percent goes to the Core member that paid to
anchor the data (326.86 TNT).

Tierion is ineligible to receive rewards. If Tierion
is selected to anchor, 100% of the reward goes to the
Node operator. 

The current Ethereum address that is used to pay rewards is:

0xdDFFF2b78463AB1cA781e853BB888FDfd06083d3

Rewards are also published as a `reward` type block in the
Calendar, permanently recording that reward and the
Ethereum address it was sent to. This ensures that
rewards are also anchored to public blockchains.


Node Minimum Balances
-----------------------------------------------------------

In order for Nodes to be eligible for TNT rewards they
must maintain certain minimum balances.

2,500 TNT (250000000000 Grains)

Nodes must also maintain enough credits to be able to
operate for 3 hours at 1 credit per second consumed.

10,800 credits


Signature Verification
-----------------------------------------------------------

This file is OpenPGP signed with the official
Tierion PGP key:

Tierion Security <security@tierion.com>
fingerprint: 86B6E539C21BCC44E3364495AB003F4636464A38
64 bit fingerprint: AB003F4636464A38

You can find the public key at one of these locations:

https://keybase.io/tierion

http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xAB003F4636464A38

The only location that should be used to retrieve this
file is the official Keybase signed filesystem for the
'tierion' account:

https://keybase.pub/tierion/

You can import the public key and verify this
file by downloading this file and its signature
and executing the following commands:

# Import the public key to gpg
curl https://keybase.io/tierion/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import

# Verify the detached signature
gpg --verify chainpoint-security.txt.sig chainpoint-security.txt

For a GOOD signature you should see something like the
following output:

gpg: Signature made Sat Jul 22 10:14:21 2017 EST
gpg:                using RSA key ED9238941FDD8A7F5401EDA9A4D3FEA87211FE71
gpg: Good signature from "Tierion Security <security@tierion.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 86B6 E539 C21B CC44 E336  4495 AB00 3F46 3646 4A38
     Subkey fingerprint: ED92 3894 1FDD 8A7F 5401  EDA9 A4D3 FEA8 7211 FE71
